## **Project Description**

This paper presents a concrete project that demonstrates using Apache Spark for building a complete machine learning pipeline to help solve a question of data science, going through the entire data science workflow. We will be presenting a variety of analyses related to data regarding Darwin's finches, a group of related species native to the Galapagos Islands. These finches were originally catalogued by Charles Darwin, and data collection of their often rapidly evolving morphology and genetic profiles has continued through to the present day. In particular, we will be examining relationships regarding datasets including genetic groupings, weather events, comparative changes over time, beak size traits, parasite-driven changes, and DNA sequences.

## **Acknowledgments**

We would like to thank our instructor, **Professor Marcelo Guerra Hahn**, and **City University of Seattle** for providing the resources and guidance needed to complete this project.
