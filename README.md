## **Project Description**

This study investigates the connections between NBA player salaries, shooting performance, and various performance metrics. By analyzing two datasets, one focused on player statistics and salaries and the other on shot data, our goal is to uncover correlations between shooting proficiency, total shots taken, and player compensation. Additional performance factors, such as assists, rebounds, and player efficiency, are also considered. The data acquisition, cleaning, and visualization processes are conducted using Python and Power BI. The outcomes of this analysis offer insights into how player performance impacts salary structures within the NBA.
